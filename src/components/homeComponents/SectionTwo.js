          <h1>What is product management?</h1>
          <p>
            Product management is an organizational function which administers each phase of product lifecycle. From development to introduction, growth, maturity and decline. To make the magic happen, a product manager ensures cohesiveness between business, design and technology to solve complex customer problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Product manager (PM) does not have direct authority over a lot of things to make their product successful - from user and data research through design and development to marketing, sales, and support. They lead teams without authority by helping them envision the greatness of what is being built and how each participant contributes to its success.
